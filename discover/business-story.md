As a sample scenario, Jane a sales executive of ACME Corporation regularly meets different customers. She needs access to latest customer information on the go. She needs a simplified web application, which can run on a portable device like smartphone or a tablet.

This scenario covers:

* Building application with SAP AppGyver
* Set up connectivity between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Cloud
